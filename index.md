## Bio

I am a Visiting Fellow at the <a href="https://cse.azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/">Centre for Sustainable Employment</a> at Azim Premji University. I graduated from Harvard University with a PhD in Public Policy in 2021.

My research focuses on labor markets in developing countries, with a specific focus on India. Recently I have been focused on understanding how the competitive exam system for government jobs interacts with the functioning of the labor market as a whole.

Abstract: Many countries allocate government jobs through a system of highly competitive exams. For example, in India, civil service exams regularly attract over a half a million applications, with an acceptance rate of less than 0.1%. This paper studies whether the intense competition for these jobs affects aggregate labor supply. To answer this question, I study how the labor market responded to a civil service hiring freeze in the state of Tamil Nadu. I find that candidates responded by spending more time studying, not less. A decade after the hiring freeze was lifted, the cohorts that were most impacted also have lower earnings, suggesting that participation in the exam process did not build human capital. Finally, I provide evidence that structural features of the testing environment—such as how well candidates are able to forecast their own performance, and the underlying returns to study effort—help explain the observed response. Together, these results indicate that public sector hiring policy has the potential to move the whole labor market.


<b>How much is a government job in India worth?</b> (draft coming soon!)

Abstract: Government jobs in India are valuable, not just because they pay relatively higher wages, but also because they provide many valuable amenities, such as lifetime tenure, access to bribes, and prestige. These jobs are generally allocated through a system of competitive exams. In this paper, I use the observed search behavior of candidates preparing for these examinations to infer a lower bound on the value of these amenities. I find that the implied amenity value is worth at least several times the nominal wage. The high amenity value is not driven by misinformed beliefs about the nominal wage, or by a high value placed on the process of studying itself. I conclude with a discussion of the implications of a high amenity value of government jobs for the design of public sector incentives, selection patterns, and the market for educated labor.
