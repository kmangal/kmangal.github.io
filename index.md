## About Me

I am a development economist and data scientist. I currently work at <a href="https://www.neo.tax/">Neo.Tax</a>.

This website is a repository for my academic work. My research focused on understanding how the competition for government jobs through merit-based exams interacts with the rest of the labor market.

The work that you see here was completed over the course of my PhD in Public Policy at Harvard University and a postdoctoral fellowship at the <a href="https://cse.azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/">Centre for Sustainable Employment</a> at Azim Premji University. 

Even though I am no longer an academic, I still hope that this work is able to find the right audience. If you would like to talk about anything you see here, feel free to reach out.

## The TNPSC Research Study

The TNPSC Research Study was a five year effort to better understand the labor market experience of candidates applying to exams conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC). 

<b>Our main findings are available in the following report:</b>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Public sector recruitment exams can be highly competitive. Does this competition encourage candidates to develop generalizable skills, or do investments in exam preparation burden candidates who fail to get selected? I address this question by studying the impact of a partial public sector hiring freeze in the state of Tamil Nadu, India on male college graduates. The hiring freeze eliminated 86% of the usual vacancies. This increased the applicant-to-vacancy ratio for the remaining posts. Cohorts that were exposed to the hiring freeze delayed full-time employment, most likely in order to invest more time in exam preparation. A decade after the hiring freeze ended, the affected cohorts demonstrate a lower earning capacity, have delayed household formation, and appear more likely to remain unemployed. Together, these results suggest that highly competitive exams encourage candidates to make investments that are ultimately unproductive.</p>

<p><b>Abstract</b>: Government jobs in developing countries are valuable not just because they pay relatively higher wages, but also because they provide many valuable amenities. How does the value of these amenities compare with the nominal wage itself? The observed search behavior of candidates preparing for competitive exams for government jobs is used to infer a lower bound on the total value of a government job, including amenities. Based on a sample of 147 candidates preparing for civil service exams in Pune, India, the amenity value of a government job is estimated to comprise at least two-thirds of total compensation. The high amenity value is not driven by misinformed beliefs about the nominal wage, nor by a high value placed on the process of studying itself. Insights from focus group discussions help explain which government job amenities are most valued in this setting.</p>
