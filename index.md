## Bio

I am a Visiting Fellow at the <a href="https://cse.azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in/">Centre for Sustainable Employment</a> at Azim Premji University and a recipient of the <a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/the-weiss-fund/about/">Weiss Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship</a>. I graduated from Harvard University with a PhD in Public Policy in 2021.

My research focuses on labor markets in developing countries, with a specific focus on India. Recently I have been studying how the competition for government jobs through merit-based exams interacts with rest of the labor market.

## Working Papers

<a href="files/papers/competitive-exams.pdf" target="_blank">Competitive Exams for Government Jobs and the Labor Supply of College Graduates in India</a>
<p style="font-size:8pt; margin-top:0; padding-top:0">Peviously circulated as "Chasing Government Jobs: How Aggregate Labor Supply Responds to Public Sector Hiring Policy in India"</p>

Abstract: Many countries allocate government jobs through a system of merit-based exams. In India, these exams are highly competitive, with selection rates often less than 0.1%. Among recent college graduates, for whom application rates are the highest, does the competition for scarce and valuable government jobs affect labor supply? To answer this question, I study the labor market impact of a partial public sector hiring freeze in the state of Tamil Nadu between 2001 and 2006, which sharply reduced the number of public sector vacancies available through exams but otherwise left aggregate labor demand intact. I find that candidates responded by spending less time employed, and more time studying. A decade after the hiring freeze was lifted, the cohorts of men that spent more time studying now work in lower-paid occupations. To compensate, they live in households with more earning members, but this also means they delay forming their own households, being more likely to remain unmarried and live with their parents. Finally, I show that the shape of the returns to study effort helps explain why it is so costly for candidates to suspend exam preparation, even when vacancy availability falls. Together, these results indicate that public sector hiring policy has the potential to move the whole labor market.


<a href="files/papers/value-govjob.pdf" target="_blank">How much is a government job in India worth?</a> 

Abstract: Government jobs in India are valuable, not just because they pay relatively higher wages, but also because they provide many valuable amenities, such as lifetime tenure, access to bribes, and prestige. Does the value of these amenities compete with the nominal wage itself? I use the observed search behavior of candidates preparing for highly structured competitive exams for government jobs to infer a lower bound on the total value of a government job, including amenities. Based on a sample of 120 male candidates preparing for state-level civil service exams in Pune, Maharashtra, I estimate a total value of <i>at least</i> 425,000 INR per month. This estimate implies that the amenity value of a government job is <i>at least</i> 81% of total compensation. The high amenity value is not driven by misinformed beliefs about the nominal wage, nor by a high value placed on the process of studying itself. I conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings for policy and the questions it raises for future research.

## Work in Progress

<b>The Underrepresentation of Women in Competitive Careers: Evidence from the Indian Civil Service</b> (joint with Niharika Singh)

Abstract: Women are often underrepresented in careers that involve competitive screening. One reason this may be the case is that norms around marriage and family formation prevent women from making as many attempts at overcoming entry barriers as men. We plan to test whether this hypothesis explains the gender gap in civil service exam results in India.


<b>What Can Online Vacancies Tell Us About Labor Market Conditions in Lower-Income Countries? Evidence from India</b> (joint with Niharika Singh and Justin Bloesch)

Abstract: In developing countries, where labor market data is often scarce and infrequently collected, online job vacancy data may provide valuable insights. However, it is still an open question whether variation in online recruitment adequately represents the broader economy in these settings. We are currently collecting data from a wide range of online job boards in India. We then plan to compare that data with existing household survey data to better understand how informative it is.
